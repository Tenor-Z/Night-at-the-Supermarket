# Night-at-the-Supermarket
One of the very first Python "games" I made in high school.\n
It sucks shit from a straw, but there's a first for everything.

# What do you do?
You have fallen asleep at your retail job in the supermarket. The lights
are out and the doors have been locked. It is up to you to find a way out, 
but it will not be easy. The Security Machine is always watching and will
catch you if you are not careful.
